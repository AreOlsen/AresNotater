# Asymptotic notation.
A function as the size of its input (the algorithm). The rate that the time/complexity instructions increases in by the number of input is called "the growth rate". We only focus on the biggest term as the function input for example $n^2+n$ we only care about the $n^2$. This example has the time complexity of $n^2$ because this value will always become the largest as $n$ increases. We also do not care about coefficients.

We have three forms of asymptotic notation.
1. [[Big theta]]
2. [[Big O]]
3. [[Big omega]]
